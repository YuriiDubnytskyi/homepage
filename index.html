                    &mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been
                    more
                    successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like
                    me.
                    Romney &mdash; I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my
                    IQ is
                    one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                    fault.

                        Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades, certificates 
                        and other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management 
                        entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, 
                        however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. 
                        I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                        Acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 
                        as the Trump Park Avenue. I sure do like my surname!

                        Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have 18 of them now in 
                        USA and abroad! Also switched to the Reform Party that year

                        Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River, which was 
                        named Trump Place. Me and the other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion 
                        and that was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City

                        story skyscraper on Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise 
                        was renamed the Trump Building

                        turned it into a 44-story luxury property known as Trump International Hotel and Tower

                        Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a waste of money, 
                        I had to sell it, now it is American Airlines Shuttle, btw

                        Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my 
                        very own Tour de Trump. Is America not great enough for that cycling competition?

                        Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million, invested $50 
                        million to restore the building and boosted it from three-star to 
                        four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot of cash in 1995)

                        I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.
                        You can join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for 
                        members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called 
                        Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!

                        I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's 
                        play schedule and filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, 
                        so NJG are not doing so good now, but back then they were great!

                        Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of 
                        undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including 
                        art deco features. All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 
                        that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed 
                        in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the 
                        Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 
                        million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!
